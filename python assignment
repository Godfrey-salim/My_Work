# Question 1 Write a program in Python which asks you to input any number of hours & converts it into seconds.
SOLUTION:
python
# Function to convert hours to seconds
def hours_to_seconds(hours):
    return hours * 3600

# Input the number of hours
hours = float(input("Enter the number of hours: "))

# Convert hours to seconds
seconds = hours_to_seconds(hours)

# Display the result
print(f"{hours} hours is equal to {seconds} seconds.")
# Question 2 Write a program in Python which asks you to input two numbers & returns the sum of them.
SOLUTION:
python
# Input two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Display the result
print(f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum_result}.")
# Question 3. Write a program in Python that asks you to enter two numbers, compares them & tells you which of them is bigger or both are equal.
SOLUTION:
python
# Input two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Compare the numbers
if num1 > num2:
    print(f"{num1} is greater than {num2}.")
elif num2 > num1:
    print(f"{num2} is greater than {num1}.")
else:
    print(f"{num1} and {num2} are equal.")
# Question 4 Write a program in Python that asks you to enter a text string & returns string 'a' replaced with '0' (for example, networkwalks should be returned as networkw0lks).
SOLUTION:
python
# Input a text string
text = input("Enter a text string: ")

# Replace 'a' with '0'
modified_text = text.replace('a', '0')

# Display the result
print(f"The modified text is: {modified_text}")
# Question 5 Write a program in Python that asks you to enter a text string & tells you its length
SOLUTION:
python
# Input a text string
text = input("Enter a text string: ")

# Calculate the length of the text
length = len(text)

# Display the result
print(f"The length of the text is: {length} characters.")
# nQuestion 6 Write a program in Python that will produce the following output using a For loop:
SOLUTION:
python
# For loop example to generate a pattern
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, i + 1):
        print('*', end=' ')
    print()
# Question 7 Write a program in Python that will produce the following output using a While loop:
SOLUTION:
python
# While loop example to generate a pattern
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    j = 1
    while j <= i:
        print('*', end=' ')
        j += 1
    print()
    i += 1
# Question 8 Write a program in Python which asks you to input two numbers & returns the average of them.
SOLUTION:
python
# Input two numbers
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the average
average = (num1 + num2) / 2

# Display the result
print(f"The average of {num1} and {num2} is {average}.")
# Question 9 Write a program in Python that will produce the following output:
SOLUTION:
python
# Example output generation program
print("Generated output:")
print("*")
print("* *")
print("* * *")
print("* * * *")
print("* * * * *")
# Question 10 nWhat will be the output of the following Python code?
python
var1 = 1
var2 = 2
var3 = "3"
print(var1 + var2 + var3)
